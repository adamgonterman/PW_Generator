# PW_Generator

## Description

I wanted to create an application that generated random passwords based on a set of constraints (number of characters, what type of characters) in order to help create strong, unique passwords for the various sites that people use. This will help the user generate different passwords for their different accounts and ensure that the password fits the constraints set by that site while also making it difficult to guess.

## Installation

Pull from my public github repository (https://github.com/adamgonterman/PW_Generator) and clone on your local machine to create a directory that allows you to run the code yourself! You can also access my portfolio at the following URL: https://adamgonterman.github.io/PW_Generator/ . 

## Usage

I have included a screenshot of the application below. The file can also be found in this repository (assets/application_screenshot.png).
