# PW_Generator

## Description

I wanted to create a random password generator with input from myself (or whoever the end user may be) so that I can create random, strong passwords for the multiple sites I use the require strong, unique passwords.

## Installation

Pull from my public github repository (https://github.com/adamgonterman/PW_Generator) and clone on your local machine to create a directory that allows you to run the code yourself! You can also access my portfolio at the following URL: https://adamgonterman.github.io/PW_Generator/ . 

## Usage

I have included a screenshot of the application below. The file can also be found in this repository (assets/application_screenshot.png).
